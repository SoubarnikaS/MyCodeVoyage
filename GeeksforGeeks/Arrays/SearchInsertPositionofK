Problem Statement :
Given a sorted array Arr[](0-index based) consisting of N distinct integers and an integer k, the task is to find the index of k, if its present in the array Arr[]. Otherwise, find the index where k must be inserted to keep the array sorted.
Input:
N = 4
Arr = {1, 3, 5, 6}
k = 5
Output: 2
Explaination: Since 5 is found at index 2 
as Arr[2] = 5, the output is 2.

Solution :
class Solution{
  public:
    int findExtra(int a[], int b[], int n) {
        
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        
        while(left <= right)
        {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if(a[mid] == b[mid])
                left = mid + 1;
            
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }
       
       return left; 
    }
};
