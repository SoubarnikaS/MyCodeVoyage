Problem Statement :
Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....
If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.
Note:The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to make changes in the original array itself.
Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2 1 4 3 5

Solution :
class Solution{
    public:
    void convertToWave(int n, vector<int>& arr){
        
         for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i += 2)
            swap(arr[i], arr[i + 1]);
            
    }
};
