Solution :
class Solution{
    //Function to find the leaders in the array.
    public:
    vector<int> leaders(int arr[], int n)
    {
        vector<int> resultant;
        
        int leader = arr[n - 1];
            
        resultant.push_back(leader);
        
        for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            if(arr[i] < leader)
                continue;
            leader = arr[i];
            resultant.push_back(leader);
        }
    
        reverse(resultant.begin(), resultant.end());
        return resultant;
        
    }
};
