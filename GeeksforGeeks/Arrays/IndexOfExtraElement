Solution :
class Solution{
  public:
    int findExtra(int a[], int b[], int n) {
        
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        
        while(left <= right)
        {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if(a[mid] == b[mid])
                left = mid + 1;
            
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }
       
       return left; 
    }
