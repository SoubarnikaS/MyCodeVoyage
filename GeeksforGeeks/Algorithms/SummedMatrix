Problem Statement :
A matrix is constructed of size n*n. such that Mi,j= i+j. Count the number of cells having value q.
Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.
Input:
n = 4, q = 7
Output:
2
Explanation:
Matrix becomes
2 3 4 5 
3 4 5 6 
4 5 6 7
5 6 7 8
The count of 7 is 2.

Solution :
class Solution {
  public:
    long long sumMatrix(long long n, long long q) {
        
       return (q > 2*n) ? 0 : (n - abs(n + 1 - q));
    }
};
