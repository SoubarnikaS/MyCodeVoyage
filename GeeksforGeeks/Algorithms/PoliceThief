Problem Statement :
Given an array of size n such that each element contains either a 'P' for policeman or a 'T' for thief. Find the maximum number of thieves that can be caught by the police. 
Keep in mind the following conditions :

Each policeman can catch only one thief.
A policeman cannot catch a thief who is more than K units away from him.

Input:
N = 5, K = 1
arr[] = {P, T, T, P, T}
Output: 2
Explanation: Maximum 2 thieves can be 
caught. First policeman catches first thief 
and second police man can catch either second 
or third thief.

Solution :
class Solution{
    public:
    int catchThieves(char arr[], int n, int k) 
    {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]=='P')
            {
                int left=i-k;
                int right=i+k;
                if(left<0)
                    left=0;
                if(right>=n)
                    right=n-1;
                while(left<=right)
                {
                    if(arr[left]=='T')
                    {
                        count++;
                        arr[left]='C';
                        break;
                    }
                    
                    left++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
