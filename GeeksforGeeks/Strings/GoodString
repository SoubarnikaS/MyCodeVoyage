Problem Statement :
Given a string s of length N, you have to tell whether it is good or not. A good string is one where the distance between every two adjacent character is exactly 1. Here distance is defined by minimum distance between two character when alphabets from 'a' to 'z' are put in cyclic manner. For example distance between 'a' to 'c' is 2 and distance between 'a' to 'y' is also 2. The task is to print "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) depending on whether the given string is Good or not.

Note: Unit length string will be always good.
Example 1:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: NO
Explanation: distance between 'a' and 'a' is not 1.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cbc"
Output: YES
Explanation: distance between 'b' and 'c' is 1.

Solution :
class Solution 
{ 
    String isGoodString(String str) 
    { 
        if(str.length() == 1)
            return "YES";
            
        for(int i = 0; i < str.length() - 1; i++)
        {

            int char1 = (int)str.charAt(i) - 97;
            int char2 = (int)str.charAt(i + 1) - 97;
            int diff = char1 > char2 ? char1 - char2 : char2 - char1;
            
            if (diff != 1 && diff != 25)
                return "NO";
        }
        return "YES";
    }
}
