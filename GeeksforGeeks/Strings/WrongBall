{
    public int countWrongPlacedBalls(String str)
    {
        int wrongBall = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++)
            if(((i + 1) % 2 == 0 && str.charAt(i) == 'R') || ((i + 1) % 2 != 0 && str.charAt(i) == 'B'))
                wrongBall++;
        
        return wrongBall;
    }

}
