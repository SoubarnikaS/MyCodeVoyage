Solution :
class Solution {
    static String snakeCase(String str , int n) {
        
       StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
        {
            if (Character.isWhitespace(str.charAt(i))) 
                result.append("_");
            else if (Character.isUpperCase(str.charAt(i)))
                result.append(Character.toLowerCase(str.charAt(i)));
            else
                result.append(str.charAt(i));
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
};
