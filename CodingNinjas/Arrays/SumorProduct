Problem Statement :
You are given a number 'N' and a queery 'Q'. If 'Q' is 1, then you have to return the sum of all integers from 1 to 'N', 
else if 'Q' is equal to 2 then you have to return the product of all integers from 1 to 'N'. Since thr product can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7

Sample Input :
2
4 1 
4 2
Explanation of the Sample Input :
In the first test case, the answer is 10 because all integers between 1 and 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Hence 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 is equal to 10.

Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
long long int sumOrProduct(long long int n, long long int q)
{
	int sum = 0; 
    long long int product = 1;
    if(q == 1)
    {
        for(int i = 1; i <= n;i++)
            sum += i;
        return sum;
    }
    else if (q == 2)
    {
        for(int i = 1; i <= n;i++)
            product = (product * i) % (1000000000 + 7);
        return product;

    }
        
}
