Problem Statement :
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Solution :
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) 
    {
        if(x < 0)
            return false;
        else
        {
            long long  rev = 0;
            int num = x;

            while(x != 0)
            {
                int n = x % 10;
                rev = rev * 10 + n;
                x /= 10;
            }
             return (num == rev);   
        }
    }
};
