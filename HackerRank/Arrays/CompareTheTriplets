Problem Statement :
Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.
The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).
The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].
If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

Sample Input :
5 6 7
3 6 10
Sample Output :
1 1

Solution :
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void compareTriplets(int alice[], int bob[], int n)
{
    int alicePoints = 0, bobPoints = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if(alice[i] > bob[i])
            alicePoints++;
        else if(bob[i] > alice[i])
            bobPoints++;
    }
    
    cout<<alicePoints<<" "<<bobPoints;
}

int main()
{
    int n = 3;
    int alice[n];
    int bob[n];
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin>>alice[i];
        
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin>>bob[i];
    
    compareTriplets(alice,bob,n);
    
}
