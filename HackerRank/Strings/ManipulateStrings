Problem Statement :
You are given two strings a and b, separated by a new line.
In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of a and b respectively.
In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b.
In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a' and n'. a' and b' are the same as a and b, respectively, except that their first characters are swapped.

Solution :
int main() 
{
    string str1,str2;
    cin>>str1>>str2;
    
    cout<<str1.length()<<" "<<str2.length()<<endl;
    cout<<str1+str2<<endl;
    cout<<str2[0] + str1.substr(1,str1.length())<<" "<<str1[0] + str2.substr(1,str2.length()); 
    
    return 0;
}
